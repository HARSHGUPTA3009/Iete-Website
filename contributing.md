   ```
   
4. Make your changes locally.
5. Commit your changes:

   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."

   ```

   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website
8. if someones pull request is already merged , don't forget to pull first then code otherwise conflicts will arrise .

## Pull Request Process 🔄

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Style Guidelines 📝

### Git Commit Messages 💬

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
